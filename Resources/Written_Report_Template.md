Conclusion
	To increase the Chances of your KickStarter being successful the optimal
 time to start your Fundraiser is May and June. Having a Goal of $10,000.00
 is the area where your kickstarter will have the most success.
 
My thoughts on Outcomes Based on Goals
	Once your Goal hits more than $9,999 the chances of your Kickstarter being successful is no longer in your favor.
 
Limitations I Noticed
	A major limtation of this data set is not having genres and more descriptive data types. 
Having a genre of play or music or category of food would help you determine what buisnesses do really well,
which have an over saturated market and popular trends.

Other Grahps We Could Use for Visualization
	We could use a bar graph to compare the market of plays to movies and other similar categories to
determine a fair price for a kickstarter and what people are willing to pay.
